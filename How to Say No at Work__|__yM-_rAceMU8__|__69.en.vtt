00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:02.511
So, you're cutting the timeline in half?

00:00:02.511 --> 00:00:04.433
Well I guess the team can't possibly

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:06.065
hate you any more than they already do,

00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:08.155
so, that's a plus!

00:00:08.155 --> 00:00:08.988
(laughs)

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:12.488
(playful orchestra music)

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.764
Obviously you don't care about my team.

00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:18.144
Obviously you don't care about quality.

00:00:18.144 --> 00:00:19.708
I hate quality.

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:20.685
I think it's stupid.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:24.783
Only a moron could hit this in this timeframe!

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:25.890
Maybe you could do it.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.203
This must be your first time running a project!

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:30.620
Oooh, totes adorbs!

00:00:31.608 --> 00:00:33.268
I have pictures of my family,

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:35.781
so why would I need to ever go home?

00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:39.088
(melancholic music)

00:00:39.088 --> 00:00:41.818
I get it, you think I'm a magician!

00:00:41.818 --> 00:00:42.708
(laughs)

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:43.541
Woo!

00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:45.880
But I--

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.713
You don't--

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.546
This isn't--

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:48.547
(playful orchestra music)

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:49.380
AAAGH!

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.804
(orchestra crescendo music)

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:54.637
Up top!

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:58.451
Yeah!
(orchestra finale)

00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:01.951
(playful orchestra music)
